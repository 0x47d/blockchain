In the context of this workshop, the following general criteria are relevant to identify when something is suitable for standardization:


## Standardization Value and Readiness 

1) Problem Statement

Is there a clear problem statement that this would solve, for a significant number of people?

2) Starting Point

Is there a good starting point, such as a clear solution, or a set of competing solutions?

3) Stakeholder Engagement

Do we have the right stakeholders ready to commit to the work, including implementers who would deploy the feature, and individuals willing to write, review, and test the specification?

## W3C Focus and Fit 

For standardization at W3C specifically, the focus is on the Web, in three main areas:

client-side (browser-based) features, like markup languages, JavaScript APIs, or user-facing features; this is our main focus
data and formats, such as interchange formats, vocabularies/ontologies, and languages to manipulate data; note that this area is usually treated with some skepticism by browser makers
communication protocols; we do this much more rarely, typically only when there's a corresponding client-side API, and usually in partnership with IETF
